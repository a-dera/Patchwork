Patchwork PHP Parser
====================

Patchwork PHP Parser is aimed at building high-performance tools for
transforming and analysing PHP code. It is written in PHP around the tokenizer
extension, runs in PHP 5.1.4+ and knows everything about PHP 5.3 and namespaces.

Here, high-performance means:

* fast,
* memory efficient,
* and easy to extend!

It can be used for example to:

* compute static code analysis,
* verify coding practices for QA,
* backport some language features,
* extend the PHP language,
* build a code preprocessor,
* build an aspect weaver,
* etc.
