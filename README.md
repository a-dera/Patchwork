Patchwork PHP Parser
====================

Patchwork PHP Parser is a wrapper around PHP's tokenizer extension.
It is aimed at building high-performance tools for transforming and analysing PHP code.
It is written in PHP, works starting from PHP 5.1.4 and knows everything about PHP 5.3 and namespaces.
Here, high-performance means:

* fast,
* memory efficient,
* and easy to extend!

It can be used for example to:

* compute static code analysis,
* backport some language features,
* extend the PHP language,
* build a code preprocessor,
* build an aspect weaver,
* etc.

See `example/`.
