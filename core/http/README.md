JSqueeze: Efficient JavaScript minification in PHP
==================================================

JSqueeze shrinks / compresses / minifies / mangles Javascript code.

It's a single PHP class licensed under Apache 2 and GPLv2 that is beeing
developed, maintained and thouroughly tested since 2003 on major JavaScript
frameworks (e.g. jQuery).

JSqueeze operates on any parse error free JavaScript code, even when semi-colons
are missing.

In term of compression ratio, it compares to YUI Compressor and UglifyJS.

Features
--------

* Removes comments and white spaces.
* Renames every local vars, typically to a single character.
* Keep Microsoft's conditional comments.
* In order to maximise later HTTP compression (deflate, gzip), new variables
  names are choosen by considering closures, variables' frequency and
  characters' frequency.
* Renames also global vars, methods and properties, but only if they are marked
  special by some naming convention. By default, special var names begin with
  one or more "$", or with a single "_".
* Renames also local/global vars found in strings, but only if they are marked
  special.
* If you use with/eval then be careful.

Bonus
-----

* Replaces false/true by !1/!0
* Replaces new Array/Object by []/{}
* Merges consecutive "var" declarations with commas
* Merges consecutive concatened strings
* Fix a bug in Safari's parser (http://forums.asp.net/thread/1585609.aspx)
* Can replace optional semi-colons by line feeds, thus facilitating output
  debugging.
* Keep important comments marked with /*!...
* Treats three semi-colons ;;; like single-line comments
  (http://dean.edwards.name/packer/2/usage/#triple-semi-colon).
* Fix special catch scope across browsers
* Work around buggy-handling of named function expressions in IE<=8

To do?
------

* foo['bar'] => foo.bar
* {'foo':'bar'} => {foo:'bar'}
* Dead code removal (never used function)
* Munge primitives: var WINDOW=window, etc.
